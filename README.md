Fighter is a short fighting game where the player uses his wisdom and fighting tactics to defeat the computer.
This was a short project for GameAThon, a 48 hour game development contest held at IIT Kanpur. It is built atop a pygame framework and works on Python 3.

Make sure you have Python3 (Pygame won't work on Python 2.7) installed on your computer.
After cloning the repository, run fighter_o.py on Python3.
